  "text": "Flamingos tend to live a long life in the wild though with an average of 20 to 30 years. In captivity some of them have lived up to 40 years.
          Flamingos communicate with a broad range of visual displays.They also use vocalizations and these displays to communicate between individuals or alert the group of possible danger.
          To take off, a flamingo runs several steps, begins flapping its wings, and lifts off into the air. When landing the procedure is reversed: the bird touches down and then runs several paces.
