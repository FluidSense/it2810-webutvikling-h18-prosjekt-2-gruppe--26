  "text": "There are a few characteristics that are different between the Old World and New World monkeys: The noses of New World monkeys are flatter than the narrow noses of the Old World monkeys, and have side-facing nostrils.
          Old World monkeys don’t have prehensile tails; New World monkeys do. Old World monkeys have cheek pouches, where food is stuffed on the run so it can be chewed later; New World monkeys don’t have cheek pouches. Old World monkeys have sitting pads on their rumps, but New World monkeys do not.
